This is plugin information for the main lua file currently know as it's beta name KaymorHC.lua

KaymorHC.lua is a survival mode scripted to monitor HP and when the hp reaches 0 you are presented a game over screen, with choose your own difficulty following the honor system.

things im trying to see done with this plugin that are beyond my capabilities:

1. i think it only works in 1920x1080 resolution, need it be universal (top priority)

2. would like the character to have to be at level 1 to start the challenge, as of right now im sure anyone can put the plugin on any character and the challenge is active (top priority)

3. checkboxes will actually save player inputs, copilot, chatgpt and myself couldn't figure it out (top priority)

4. checkboxes actually produce a game over screen for the box that's checked if that rule is broken

5. beta file names renamed to better reflect the plugin without the .plugin and .lua breaking.

6. The key to reset the button is currently F7 because in order for the plugin to detect the keystoke the key needs to be binded in game. i choose a default key so no one forgets to set the key. if anyone as better ideas than F7 let me know but it has to be a default binded key(like g doesn't work since it's not a key used by default).

7. I originally had the plugin completely disable if a game over screen was triggered, but because of possible false game overs from things like abilities and quests i decided to remove the disabling feature. If there's a way to for people to use these abilities and do quests that kill them without trigging a game over screen id like to add this back. at least the abilities as the quests can most likely be avoided.

8. If you fail your challenge and delete your character the plugin remembers the character's name, so if you reuse the same name you just failed with the new character will have a game over screen. would like people to be able to reuse their names, if possible

KaymorHC.lua and KaymorHC.plugin are listed here for download if you'd like to help.
